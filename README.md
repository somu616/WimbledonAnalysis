Analysis of past 10 years of wimbledon matches.

Story-:

•	Chart 1 – Winner Error vs Winner Net
I drew a correlation between the 
	aggregated average value for Winner’s Error across all matches that happened that year
vs the 
	aggregated average value for Winner’s Net across all matches that happened that year

This showed a direct correlation between the two.

Hence, we could say that whenever the Winner’s Net Percentage was high the Winner’s Error Percentage was high and vice versa.

•	Chart 2 – Winner Double vs Winner Returns
Similarly, I drew a correlation between the 
	aggregated average value for Winner’s Double across all matches that happened that year
vs the 
	aggregated average value for Winner’s Returns across all matches that happened that year

This showed an inverse correlation.

Hence, we could say that whenever the Winner’s Double Number was high the Winner’s Returns numbers were low and vice versa.

Color-:
I chose Red and Blue colors since it has a really stark contrast difference between the two and is easier for color blind people to see as well.
Also, I colored the axis with the same color as the line to make it easier for user to understand which axis is for which line.

Type of Visualization -:
I chose to create a Dual Axis Y chart using D3 to show the relation between the 2 lines. 
It’s really easy to see the co-relation when both lines are shown in the same graph
You can also click on the legend to show only 1 line and its respective axis to see the values up close.

Interaction -:
•	You can click on the 2 radio buttons to toggle between the 2 charts.
•	You can click on the legend to show only that specific line with its axis. The Legend value being shown gets highlighted in red color.
o	You can click on the value again to show both the lines again.
